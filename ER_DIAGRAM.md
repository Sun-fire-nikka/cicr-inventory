# UML Class Diagram

This diagram models the core data entities in the CICR VAULT backend
(`users`, `inventory`, `borrow_records`, `audit_logs` in Supabase/Postgres) as UML
classes, including the main operations exposed on each via the Express API.

## Accuracy notes

The entities, attributes, and relationship cardinalities in this diagram match the
real database schema (verified against the Supabase queries in
`backend/src/modules/**/*.controller.ts`). A couple of things worth knowing before
treating it as a literal description of the codebase:

- **The backend has no classes.** `register()`, `login()`, `getItems()`,
  `borrowItem()`, `logAudit()`, etc. are plain Express controller functions living in
  `backend/src/modules/<feature>/<feature>.controller.ts` — not methods on `User`,
  `InventoryItem`, or `BorrowRecord` objects. The diagram groups them under each
  entity for readability, but there's no OOP structure to match it 1:1.
- **`DashboardService`** is shown aggregating both `InventoryItem`/`User` stats and
  `AuditLog`, but in the code these are two separate endpoints — `GET /api/stats`
  (`getDashboardStats()`) and `GET /api/audit` (`getAuditLogs()`) — not one combined
  call.
- `Category` (`Controllers | Sensors | Power | Actuators | Tools`) and `Role`
  (`ADMIN | MEMBER`) are correctly modeled as enums; `BorrowStatus`
  (`BORROWED | RETURNED`) likewise.
- `BorrowRecord.user_id` and `inventory_id`, and `AuditLog.user_id`/`item_id`, are
  foreign keys referencing `User` and `InventoryItem` respectively — the diagram's
  relationship lines capture this correctly even though the attribute list doesn't
  explicitly tag them `FK`.

## Entity summary

| Entity          | Backed by table   | Key relationships                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `User`           | `users`            | 1 → many `BorrowRecord`, 1 → many `AuditLog`          |
| `InventoryItem`  | `inventory`        | 1 → many `BorrowRecord`, 1 → many `AuditLog`          |
| `BorrowRecord`   | `borrow_records`   | belongs to one `User`, one `InventoryItem`            |
| `AuditLog`       | `audit_logs`       | optionally references one `User`, one `InventoryItem` |

There is no direct relationship between `AuditLog` and `BorrowRecord` — a
borrow/return action writes both a `BorrowRecord` row and a separate `AuditLog` row,
but they aren't foreign-keyed to each other.
